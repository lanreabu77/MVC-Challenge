# Functionality

The Tech Blog application offers the following functionalities:

User Registration and Login: Developers can easily sign up with a unique username and password to create an account. Once registered, they can log in using their credentials.

Homepage: Upon entering the site, users are greeted with the homepage, where they can explore existing blog posts, if any have been published. They can access the homepage by selecting the corresponding option.

Navigation: The application features a user-friendly navigation bar that provides quick access to essential sections like the homepage, dashboard, and logout option. Users can seamlessly switch between different parts of the website.

Commenting: Users have the ability to engage with blog posts by leaving comments. When reading a post, they can enter their comments and submit them. The system saves the comments along with the username and the date of creation, displaying them alongside the blog post.

Dashboard: Once logged in, users gain access to their personal dashboard, showcasing their own blog posts. From the dashboard, they can conveniently view, edit, or delete their posts. Moreover, the option to create a new blog post is readily available.

User Session Management: To ensure security, if a user remains inactive on the site for a specified period, they will be prompted to log in again before performing actions such as adding, updating, or deleting posts. This ensures the safety of user sessions and data.
